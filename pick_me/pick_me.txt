Hi there! I am a very passionate programmer with hands on experience in
Python Django, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript MEAN stack and other front end
technologies from a coding bootcamp. I currently volunteer at 
Police and Fire: the fallen heroes as a Front End Web Developer.

I self-studied general computer science in order to become a better 
developer, I have good understanding in computer system(CPU, memory model,
bit-level operation, etc), algorithms, and data structures. I practiced 
algorithms a lot at Codewars and rank as 'competent' / 'kyu 4'.

I love to communicate and always try to be helpful, and I am a very positive 
person, I always bring positive energy to the team. 

I see this is a very good opportunity for me to sharpen my skills in web development
and programming, I am striving to get more experience in real production environment.
